This repository contains problems, which can be solved by using Binary Search.<br>
Predicate framework of Binary Search - https://www.topcoder.com/community/competitive-programming/tutorials/binary-search/<br>

1. unknown_order - Array is sorted, but do not know in which order.<br>
2. [firstAndLastOccurence](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/) - A sorted array may contain duplicates. Find the first and last occurence of a particular element. <br>
3. [rotationSortedArray](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array) - A sorted array is rotated. Find the minimum. <br>
4. [searchingInSortedArray](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/) - A sorted array with distinct elements is rotated. Find a particular element. NOTE: If duplicates are present, this won't work. <br>
5. searchInAlmostSortedArray - Given an array in which every element is misplace by atmost one place, search for an element.<br>
6. [floorInSortedArray](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/floor-in-a-sorted-array/) - Given a sorted array, find the greatest element which is smaller than or equal to a given element. Else print -1. <br>
7. [ceilInSortedArray](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ceiling-in-a-sorted-array/) - Given a sorted array, find the smallest element which is greater than or equal to a given element. Else print -1. <br>
8. nextCharacter - Given a sorted array of characters, find the next character in the array for a particular element. Return '#' if not.
9. [infinitelySortedArray](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-position-element-sorted-array-infinite-numbers/) - Given a sorted array of infinite numbers, search for an element.
10. [firstOneInBinarySortedArray](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-index-first-1-sorted-array-0s-1s/) - Given a sorted array consisting 0’s and 1’s. The problem is to find the index of first ‘1’ in the sorted array. It could be possible that the array consists of only 0’s or only 1’s. If 1’s are not present in the array then print “-1”. <br>
11. minimumDifferenceElement - Given a sorted array, find the element in the array which gives minimum difference wrt to a given number. <br>
11. sqrtOfNumber -Write a program to find the square-root of a number.<br>
12. [peakElement](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/) - A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors. Given an input array nums, where nums[i] ≠ nums[i+1], find a peak element and return its index. The array may contain multiple peaks, in that case return the index to any one of the peaks is fine. Assume that nums[-1] and nums[n] are infinity. <br>
13. peakElementInBitonicArray - Bitonic array is which in elements first strictly increase then strictly decrease.<br>
14. [bitonicArraySearch](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-element-bitonic-array/) - Search for an element in bitonic array. <br>
15. [2dArrayBS](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix-ii/) - Given a m by n matrix in which elements in each row and column are sorted in increasing order. Search for an element. <br>
16. [allocateMinimumNoOfPages](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/allocate-minimum-number-pages/) - Given number of pages in n different books and m students. The books are arranged in ascending order of number of pages. Every student is assigned to read some consecutive books. The task is to assign books in such a way that the maximum number of pages assigned to a student is minimum. <br>
